I am originally from Russellville, Alabama, and did my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Auburn University, Alabama. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on  the applications of machine learning to Proteins at Virginia Tech. In my free time, I enjoy biking, cooking, playing piano, making coffee/espresso, 3D printing, and gaming. One of my most memorable experiences was going on a backpacking trip across Europe with some of my best friends, where we visited Paris, London, Rome, and Naples.
